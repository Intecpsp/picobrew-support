# picobrew-support

This is a mirror of the official documentation found on the [Picobrew site](https://picobrew.com/About/ProductResources/default). This repo is for use after the official servers go dark.

The driving factor behind this repos creation, was to keep access to the "Unlisted" YouTube videos linked on their support site. But I decided after grabbing those, that everything else could be useful as well; so here we are.

**Disclaimer**: Information on this repo was pulled straight from the Picobrew site with very little manipulation (formatting), none of the information in the repo is mine, some information may be out of date or links may no longer work.
