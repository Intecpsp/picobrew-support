## Brewing on the Pico C Questions

* How long does it take to brew?
    * Pico's brew cycle takes a little over 2 hours to complete, depending on the specific PicoPak recipe. After the brew cycle is finished the beer will need to ferment for up to approximately a week before you drink it (fermentation times vary by beer). Keg conditioning (natural carbonation) takes about twice the amount of time it took for fermentation or forced carbonation takes 36 hours. From PicoPak to pint the whole process will take approximately 7-10 days.
* What's the highest ABV I can reach with Pico?
    * We've produced PicoPaks that create up to 10% ABV beers.
* Are there any beer styles you can't make on the Pico?
    * No, it is possible to create PicoPaks for all the major beer styles. Our brewery partners are making PicoPaks for many different styles of beer.

## After Brewing Questions

* How do I know when my beer is done fermenting?
    * The fermentation process and its completion are functions of several variables, including: beer wort, time, temperature, aeration, and yeast. We provide you with a fermentation temperature decal that will give guidance on the ideal temperature range for fermentation depending on the beer style you brewed. Consult the table in the manual to see how long Fast Fermentation should take for your beer. You can also remove the lid from your brew keg to check fermentation status. Your beer is done fermenting when it is clear with little to no foam or some larger cola sized bubbles.
* How do I transfer/rack my beer from a brewing keg to an empty keg?
    * Connect the Pico C unit's gray connector to the "IN" post and the racking tube to the "OUT" post. Turn on your Pico, scroll to Utilities and select Rack Beer. Pico will pump air into the brewing keg which will force the beer in the brewing keg over into the clean keg. This process will take roughly 10 minutes to complete. Do not leave the Pico or kegs unattended while racking beer.
* How do I carbonate my beer once it's fermented?
    * Using Pico C accessories, you can carbonate your beer by keg conditioning (natural carbonation). Pour provided sugar packet into Keg with your racked beer. Let the keg sit undisturbed in the same area that you fermented the beer for about twice the amount of time it took for original fermentation, or until fully carbonated. Chill in refrigerator before serving. A CO2 regulator, cartridges and carbonation adapter can be purchased separately on BrewGear for forced carbonation.
* Is the Pico C Brew Keg dishwasher safe?
    * Yes, the Pico C Brew Keg can be cleaned in the dishwasher. The Gasket on the Keg Lid should be hand washed.

## PicoPak Questions

        * Hops are placed in 4 separate compartments, so we can achieve high bitterness or intense hop flavor in a multi-stage boil.

* How much do PicoPaks cost?
    * Most PicoPaks cost between $19.00 and $30.00, depending on the beer and the ingredients. You can view our selection of PicoPaks in our BrewMarketplace.
* Can I add my own ingredients to Pico?
    * Yes. Using the Pico Manual Brewing function you can design your own craft beer and use your own ingredients. See the online Manual Brew Guide under Resources. Alternatively, you can create custom PicoPaks using our Freestyle PicoPak generator, which will allow you to select which hops, grains and yeast you'd like, and the amounts of each. We’ll send you your custom PicoPak already pre-packaged and ready to brew.
* Can I create and brew my own recipes?
    * Yes. Right now there are 4 ways to customize your beer:
        * Purchase a PicoPak and customize the bitterness and/or ABV percentage to your preference right before brewing.
        * Purchase a Freestyle PicoPak. Our online Freestyle PicoPak crafter allows you select the hops, grains, yeast, and amounts of each. We will then ship your Freestyle Pak to you fully packaged and ready to brew.
        * Create your own totally custom PicoPaks by joining the PicoBrew Developers Program.  You can develop these PicoPaks using loose ingredients on a Zymatic and then publish them as PicoPaks on BrewMarketplace.  PicoBrew takes care of sales, packaging and fulfillment and you earn a commission on each sale of your original PicoPak recipe.
        * Create your own custom recipe online using our Recipe Crafter for Manual Brewing, then use your own ingredients with Brew Bags and Manual Brewing on the Pico. You can find Brew Bags in the PicoBrew BrewGear store.
* Do you guys make Gluten-Free PicoPaks?
    * We do not offer Gluten Free PicoPaks, however, there a couple options open to you. You can create your own gluten free recipe and then use your own ingredients with Brew Bags and Manual Brewing on the Pico. Alternatively, we offer White Labs Clarity Ferm in the PicoBrew BrewGear store. Depending on your sensitivity to gluten, this reduction may or may not meet your dietary needs.
* What's the shelf-life of the PicoPaks?
    * This will depend on the recipe. We are targeting a six-month shelf life. If you are using a recipe with liquid yeast you'll need to take that out of the kit and refrigerate it upon arrival. If you are not going to brew immediately after receiving your PicoPak you should also store the hops in your refrigerator.
* How much can I adjust the ABV/IBU of each PicoPak?
    * It depends on the recipe, but typically within +/- 5% of the original recipe target.
* How do I dry-hop my beer?
    * Each PicoPak that requires dry hopping will come with a dry hop sachet which you'll drop into your brewing keg after your beer is done fermenting. Let your beer sit with the dry hops for 4 more days.
* Will PicoPaks contain dry yeast or liquid yeast?
    * Each PicoPak will have a "default" yeast that was chosen by the brewery. Default yeasts can be dry or liquid and in some cases customers will have several yeast options to choose from.
* I want my local brewery to make PicoPaks! How can I connect them to you?

Once you approve your PicoPak, your creation will be listed on BrewMarketplace.
